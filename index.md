My name is Alexander Yang, and I'm currently a junior at MIT studying machine learning. I'm also a teaching assistant for 6.867, MIT's graduate machine learning course. Currently, my interests in machine learning remain pretty broad, but I'm especially interested in building generative models and reading about ideas which mimic human cognition and behavior. 

I hope to document what I've learned from my classes and projects <a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url}}/blog">here</a>. I'm also actively looking for research opportunities or interesting papers to read. Please feel free to email me at alexy[at]mit[dot]edu regarding any feedback on anything I write, or regarding papers/research.
