My name is Alexander Yang, and I'm currently a senior at MIT studying computer science, with a focus on machine learning. In the past, I've been a teaching assistant for 6.036, MIT's introductory machine learning class, and 6.867, MIT's graduate machine learning class. Currently, my interests in machine learning remain pretty broad, but I'm especially interested in building generative models and reading about ideas which mimic human cognition and behavior.

Last summer, I had the wonderful experience of working with the machine learning and data science team at GoDaddy. Since then, I've also become a lot more interested in a few technical challenges common in industry:
- How do you most effectively deal with high class imbalance in a dataset?
- How do you robustly determine whether changes made to a model result in an improvement in performance?
- What are the best practices for dealing with [technical debt in ML systems](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf)?

Please feel free to contact me at alexy[at]mit[dot]edu regarding anything.

I hope to document what I've learned from my classes and projects <a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url}}/blog">here</a>. I'm also actively looking for research opportunities or interesting papers to read. Please feel free to email me at alexy[at]mit[dot]edu regarding any feedback on anything I write, or regarding papers/research. -->
