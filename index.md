My name is Alexander Yang, and I'm currently a junior at MIT studying machine learning. I'm also a teaching assistant for 6.867, MIT's graduate machine learning course. Currently, my interests in machine learning remain pretty broad, but I'm especially interested in the idea of developing cognitively-inspired computational models, such as <a href="https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00771ED1V01Y201704CAC039">this one</a>, which may eventually compete with deep neural networks. 

I hope to document what I've learned from my classes <a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url}}/blog">here</a>. I'm also actively looking for research opportunities or interesting papers to read. Please feel free to email me at alexy[at]mit[dot]edu regarding any feedback on anything I write, or regarding papers/research.
